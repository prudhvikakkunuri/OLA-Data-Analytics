#🚗 OLA Data Analysis | Power BI

##📄 Overview
This project involved creating an insightful and interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key metrics such as order bookings, revenue, ratings, and cancellations across different vehicle type sub-categories over a span of two years. The primary objective was to deliver clear and actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

##✨ Key Features
🔍 Comprehensive Data Analysis: ➡️ Designed and developed a detailed Power BI report to analyze trends in order bookings, revenue, customer ratings, and cancellations. Insights were categorized by vehicle types, enabling a granular analysis across a two-year period.

##🛠️ Data Cleaning & Transformation: ➡️ Utilized Power Query Editor to perform advanced data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing. This ensured the dataset was structured, consistent, and ready for seamless analysis.

##📊 Dynamic Calculations with DAX: ➡️ Leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create robust measures and calculated columns. This enabled advanced computations such as revenue projections, average ratings, and cancellation rates.

##🖥️ Interactive Visualizations: ➡️ Developed interactive dashboards with user-friendly charts, cards, tables, and slicer filters. This allowed stakeholders to explore the data intuitively, uncover patterns, and drill down into specific metrics.

##💡 Actionable Insights: ➡️ Delivered a visually engaging dashboard that highlighted critical business insights, such as identifying high-performing vehicle types and detecting areas requiring operational improvements.
